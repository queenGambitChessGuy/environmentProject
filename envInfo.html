            <li>The world has over 3.04 trillion trees in the world. However, 27,000 of them are cut down daily to make toilet paper. <br>This translates to about 9.8 million trees annually.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Rainforests are being cut down at a rate of 100 acres per minute. If this trend continues, the world’s rainforests will <br>be gone by 2100.</li>
            <br>
            <li>About 71% of the earth is water. The oceans hold approximately 96.5% of this water and the ice caps hold about 2%.
